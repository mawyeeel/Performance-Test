        <h1>Marielle Angel Charishe M. Limbo</h1>
        <p align="justify">On May 28, 2002, my mother gave birth to a healthy baby girl
        and named her Marielle Angel Charishe M. Limboâ€”me. I was
        born in Brgy. Tres, Poblacion, Buenavista, Marinduque and I am
        currently living in Bantad, Bantauyan, Boac, Marinduque.</p>
        <p align="justify">I finished my elementary education at Caigangan Elementary
        School in Buenavista and finished my Junior High School in
        Buenavista National High School. For my Senior High School, I
        chose the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
        (STEM) as my strand in Marinduque State College and
        graduated as one of the students in our class with honors in
        2020.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the same year, I enrolled in as a college student in
            Marinduque State College and I chose Bachelor of Science in
            Information Technolog. As for my work experience, I actually
            planned on applying to a bunch of internships in the city but
            since the pandemic happened, I wasn't able to do it though I'd
            love to have even a small experience in the field as early as
            possible.</p>
        <p align="justify">I would love to try new things that is technology related
            because I am really fascinated when it comes to new
            technological advancements. My brother who are also working
            in the same field for a couple of years now and I are planning
            to buy a drone so that we can experience it and maybe turn it
            into something that can give us income. Aside from that, sci-fi
            movies and other science related things always catched my
            attention because it makes me wonder about a lot of things in
            our society, surroundings and of course the universe.</p>
        <p align="justify">My dream is to be a programmer. But being a programmer is
            not easy that is why I need to strive hard and make myself
            familiar to programming languages and programming related
            things. Aside from that, in order for me to be a good
            programmer, I must also posses skills such as communication
            skills, teamwork, self management and I should also be
            teachable because there's always a lot of room to grow.</p>
